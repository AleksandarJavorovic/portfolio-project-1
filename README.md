## **Features**

### **Header**

The website is built upon principles of responsive design, therefore the header, as well as other parts of site, look slightly different on devices with different screen sizes. Within the header we have company name(logo) on the left side, as well as navigation bar which contains 4 elements on bigger screens, on smaller screens is swaped with the so-called burger icon, which is drop-down menu. Elements of the header have naming and icon appropriate to the content which follows behind.

- **Mobile Phone**

![Mobile Phone header](assets/images/features/header-mobile.png)

when the burger button is pressed:

- **Desktop**

![Desktop header](assets/images/features/header-desktop.png)

### **Home Page**

Do your thing and let the furniture design/assembly be our concern.

That's the phrase which welcomes the user landing on the home page. It is simple, straight to the point and it contains the keywords representing our services. That should be enough to get them interested and to know we are one-stop destination for all furniture needs.

![Desktop Home Page](assets/images/features/index-desktop.png)

### **About Us Page**

Name of the page tells us more or less everything what user can expect here. About us page is here to introduce XYZcellent Solutions to the future customer and let him know something more about the company, our goals etc.

Here we have three sections:

1. **Who are we?**

![About Us Page](assets/images/features/about-us-1-desktop.png)

2. **How it all started?**

![About Us Page](assets/images/features/about-us-2-desktop.png)

3. **What is our goal?**

![About Us Page](assets/images/features/about-us-3-desktop.png)

### **Our Work Page**

Guided by the saying:"a picture says more than a thousand words", at this page are many photos which show our previous work and give the user an idea of our capabilities.

![Our Work Page](assets/images/features/our-work-desktop.png)

### **Contact Us Page**

Hoping that we have sparked the desire of users to buy our services, at this page is everything they need to get in touch with us and that is:

- Form to fill in and leave message/question if desired.
- Our address with working times.
- Extra iframe of google maps for easier navigation.

![Contact Us Page](assets/images/features/contact-us-desktop.png)

### **Thank You Page**

This page is very similar to Contact Us, only difference is that instead of form, there is a message that form has been submited. To achieve this I had to change method to GET.

![Thank You Page](assets/images/features/thank-you-desktop.png)

### **Footer**

The footer itself is pretty basic but yet functional. It contains links to social networks presented in a form of icons. The links will pop up in new tabs as instructed by our teachers.

- **Mobile Phones**

- Add more content to our work page on a regular basis.
- Add extra page about techniques and materials being used.
- Add phone number to the contact us page(don't know how I forgot about that).
