## **[Features](#features)**

### **Header**
The website is built upon principles of responsive design, therefore the header, as well as other parts of site, look slightly different on devices with different screen sizes. Within the header we have company name(logo) on the left side, as well as navigation bar which contains 4 elements on bigger screens, on smaller screens is swaped with the so-called burger icon, which represents drop-down menu. Elements of the header have naming and icon appropriate to the content which follows behind.

* **Mobile Phone**
